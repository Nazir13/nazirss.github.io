            <p>Hi, there! I'm Manling. I am an assistant professor at the Computer Science department of <a href="#">Northwestern University</a>. In the meantime, I am visiting <a href="#">Stanford University</a>, where I was a postdoc and fortunate to be advised by Prof <a href="#">Jiajun Wu</a> and mentored by Prof <a href="#">Fei-Fei Li</a> with support partially from Microsoft Research Postdoc Fellowship. Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at <a href="#">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a> in 2023. I was fortunate to have Prof <a href="#">Heng Ji</a> as my advisor and grateful for the mentorship from Prof <a href="#">Shih-Fu Chang</a>, Prof <a href="#">Kyunghyun Cho</a> and Prof <a href="#">Jiawei Han</a>, and for receiving the support from Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship.</p>

            <p>I aim to make AI and LLMs beneficial for humans, working at the intersection of language, vision, robotics, and their impact on society. I focus on Knowledgeable Foundation Models for <strong>Reasoning, Planning, Compositionality</strong>, with applications in Embodied AI and AI for science. At the core of my research, I aim to make machines to interact with <strong>physical world</strong> via <strong>multimodal data (Language + X, where X can be robotics, vision, audio, etc)</strong>. The ultimate goal of my research is to promote <strong>trustworthiness and truthfulness</strong> in through a structured view that is easily explainable, highly compositional, and capable of long-horizon reasoning.</p>

            <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Her work on multimodal knowledge extraction won the <strong>ACL20 Best Demo Paper Award</strong>, the work on scientific information extraction from COVID literature won <strong>NAACL21 Best Demo Paper Award</strong>, the work on controlling LLMs (LM-Steer) won <strong>ACL24 Outstanding Paper Award</strong>. She was a recipient of <strong>Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship</strong> in 2021. She was selected as a <strong>DARPA Riser</strong> in 2022 (nominated by DARPA), and a <strong>EE CS Rising Star</strong> in 2022. She was awarded C.L. Dave and Jane W.S. Liu Award, and has been selected as a Mavis Future Faculty Fellow. <strong>She led 19 students to develop the UIUC information extraction system and ranked 1st in DARPA AIDA evaluation each phase</strong>. She gave tutorials about multimodal knowledge at ACL21, AAAI'21, NAACL22, AAAI'23, CVPR'23, IJCAI'24, and serves as Organizing Committee of ACL25, NAACL25, EMNLP'24, etc</p>

            <p>ðŸ“§ Prospective students: I have 3-5 PhD positions and 1 postdoc position in Fall 2025 or later. Please...</p>
